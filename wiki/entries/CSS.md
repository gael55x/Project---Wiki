# CSS

CSS is a language that can be used to add style to an [HTML](/wiki/HTML) page.

CSS uses a set of rules to define how elements should be styled. These rules consist of selectors, which target specific elements, and declarations, which define the styles to be applied. Here's an example of a CSS rule:

```css
h1 {
    color: blue;
    font-size: 24px;
}
    font-size: 24px;
}
